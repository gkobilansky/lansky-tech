    question: "What types of web applications do you specialize in building?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
        We specialize in three main areas:
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-1">
          <li>High-performance web applications with real-time features, streaming video, authentication, and payment systems</li>
          <li>Custom e-commerce solutions with optimized checkout flows, subscription management, and payment processing</li>
          <li>Conversion-focused marketing sites with immersive product showcases and content management systems</li>

    question: "What's the difference between a web application and a website?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
        While both are accessed through browsers, they serve different purposes:
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-1">
          <li>A website primarily delivers information to visitors - like a digital brochure. Even with a CMS, it mainly focuses on content presentation and basic user interactions.</li>
          <li>A web application is interactive software that runs in the browser, allowing users to perform complex tasks, manipulate data, and create content. Examples include email clients, project management tools, or online banking platforms.</li>
        </ul>
        The key difference is in user interaction - websites are mostly read-only, while web applications enable users to create, modify, and process data in real-time.

    question: "How can I sell more online?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">

  {
    question: "How do you measure success?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
        Success is measured through concrete business outcomes:
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-1">
          <li>For e-commerce: conversion rates, average order value, and checkout completion rates</li>
          <li>For web applications: user engagement, retention metrics, and system performance</li>
          <li>For marketing sites: lead generation, bounce rates, and conversion goals</li>
        </ul>
        We establish clear KPIs at the start of each project and continuously monitor these metrics to ensure we're delivering real business value.
